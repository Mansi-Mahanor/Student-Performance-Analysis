# Student Performance Analysis using Python

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to identify factors
that affect academic results using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis
- Study time vs final grade
- Impact of absences on performance
- Correlation between grades (G1, G2, G3)

## Key Insights
- Study time shows a positive relationship with final grades.
- Previous failures negatively affect student performance.
- Absences have a noticeable impact on academic results.
- G1 and G2 grades strongly influence the final grade G3.

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that study habits and attendance play an important
role in student academic performance.
